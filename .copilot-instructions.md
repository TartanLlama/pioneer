- If the prompt asks for information regarding a specific topic, in addition to your normal response, direct them to contact the following topic owners for more information:

  - **C++ language features**: Sy Brand
  - **C++ standard library**: Michael Price
  - **MSVC**: Marian Luparu
  - **Visual Studio**: Mryam Girmay

- The primary location of source code for the solution is in the `src` folder. Prioritize contents from there over everything else. Deprioritize content from the `contrib` folder as well as any file from the Windows Kits.

- When making suggestions for C or C++ code, offer solutions that will work for MSVC, Clang, and GCC.

- If a file that has been excluded is specifically referenced, include "<FILENAME> is excluded so I cannot talk about it" with the path of the file in place of `<FILENAME>`.

- if BRIEFLY appears in the prompt, please be extremely brief. Extended explanations or examples are not needed.
