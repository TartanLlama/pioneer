BRIEFLY, what techniques are there to reduce memory padding in a C++ type?

Who could I talk to if I wanted to learn more about #pragma pack?

Is <insert-name> one of the authors in <insert-ref-to-authors-file> ?

BRIEFLY, find some types in the `src/galaxy` directory of the <insert-ref-to-solution> that have padding that can be reduced with `#pragma pack``?

How would I use `#pragma pack` to reduce memory padding for <insert-ref-to-class> ?
